The problem for day 23 is a variation of the [Tower of Hanoi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). In this case we are moving amphipods around to group them up in alphabetical order. This is one of those Advent of Code probelems that is easier to do by hand, which I did. I tried to write a gleam solution, but after a few days I gave up. I did not want to spend more time on this problem.

The general idea behinf my solution was to use [A* algorthim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find the moves that require the least amount of total energy.

Maybe I will come back to this problem in the future, but for now I am moving on to the next problem.
